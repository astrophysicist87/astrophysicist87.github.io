This crash course consists simply of three analyses show casing different 
basic functionalities. 

Try first and do:
rivet-mkanalysis TEST_ANALYSIS to generate an analysis skeleton
Then build it with rivet-buildplugin RivetTEST_ANALYSIS.so TEST_ANALYSIS.cc

Your analysis does not do much at this point. Inspect it by opening TEST_ANALYSIS.cc
with a text editor, and read the three analysis steps.

We will look at a real analysis instead.
Open ../analyses/pluginALICE/ALICE_2015_I1357424.cc
Compare to histograms in gvim ../analyses/pluginALICE/ALICE_2015_I1357424.yoda
They can be found at inspire -> data -> hepdata: http://inspirehep.net/record/1357424

Read through and understand the analysis.

Edit your test analysis to simply produce the pT distribution of all charged particles.

Build it.

Make sure that rivet knows about this path:
export RIVET_ANALYSIS_PATH=$(PWD)

Now sign up for the analyses you would like to look at:
